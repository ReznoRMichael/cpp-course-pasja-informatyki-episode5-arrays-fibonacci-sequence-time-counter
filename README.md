> Training course - Pasja Informatyki, C++ course, episode 5 ( [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt1HnMdzINo) )

## General info
The basics of using arrays. Create an array of 100000 long double elements, input the amount of numbers in the sequence to calculate. Start a simple time counter using `time.h` and `windows.h`. Calculate and save the numbers in the array using for loop. Option to show each number in the sequence currently on screen. After ending calculate the golden proportion number, show it on the screen, and stop the timer counter. Calculate the time it took to complete the task and output it on the screen in seconds in a fixed 3 precision.
